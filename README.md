# Overview

This program was developed to showcase the fundamental concepts of the Kotlin programming language and its integration with Android Studio for the creation of Android applications.

The program developed is a simple calculator featuring essential arithmetic functions such as multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition for two numbers. 
Additionally, it includes convenient features such as a clear button to erase all operations, a delete button to remove a single character, a dot button to add decimal points, and a sign switch button to change the number's symbol. All operations are performed between two numbers.

The main goal of developing this software was for me to apply all of Kotlin basics on a functional program. By creating a functional calculator, I aimed to showcase the practical implementation of key Kotlin concepts and features, such as data types, variables, functions, control flow, and object-oriented programming principles. This project served as an opportunity for me to reinforce and showcase my fundamental knowledge of Kotlin through a real-world application.

# Future Work

- Implement parentheses functionality to handle complex mathematical expressions.
- Utilize XML grid layout for organizing the calculator buttons to enhance user interface.
- Incorporate exponentiation feature to enable calculations involving powers.
- Extend the calculator's capabilities to support arithmetic operations between multiple numbers, following the PEMDAS order of operations for accurate calculations.
